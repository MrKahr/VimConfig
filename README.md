# VimConfig
My Current Vim configuration that I use when writing solo projects. 

My philosophy when setting up this configurations file has been to avoid plugins in favour of a vim-native alternative. 

## Current features
The current features of this configuration file are listed below in no particular order:
- [x] Syntax highlighting
- [x] Search highlighting
- [x] Tab identation configured
- [x] Vim command autocompletion (NOTE: different from source code auto completion)
- [x] Mouse input enabled
- [x] Line/column indicator at screen buttom
- [x] Mappings for file navigation when editing multiple files

The config file is a reflection of me trying to learn more about Vim.

You are free to use it as starter configuration for your own vim config, as long as you provide credit to the author.
